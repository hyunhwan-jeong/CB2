## What is CB<sup>2</sup>

CB<sup>2</sup>(CRISPRBetaBinomial) is a new algorithm for analyzing CRISPR data based on beta-binomial distribution. 
We provide CB<sup>2</sup> as a R package, and the interal algorithms of CB<sup>2</sup> are also implemented in [CRISPRCloud](http://crispr.nrihub.org/).

## Update

### July 2, 2019 

There are several updates.

* We have change the function name for the sgRNA-level test to `measure_sgrna_stats`. The original name `run_estimation` has been *deprecated*.
* CB<sup>2</sup> now supports a `data.frame` with character columns. In other words, you can use 

## How to install

Currently CB<sup>2</sup> is now on `CRAN`, and you can install it using `install.package` function.

```r
install.package("CB2")
```

Installation Github version of CB<sup>2</sup> can be done using the following lines of code in your R terminal.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LiuzLab/CB2")
```

Alternatively, here is a one-liner command line for the installation.

```
Rscript -e "install.packages('devtools'); devtools::install_github('LiuzLab/CB2')"
```

## A simple example how to use CB<sup>2</sup> in R

```r
FASTA <- system.file("extdata", "toydata",
                     "small_sample.fasta",
                     package = "CB2")
df_design <- data.frame()
for(g in c("Low", "High", "Base")) {
  for(i in 1:2) {
    FASTQ <- system.file("extdata", "toydata",
                         sprintf("%s%d.fastq", g, i), 
                         package = "CB2")
    df_design <- rbind(df_design, 
      data.frame(
        group = g, 
        sample_name = sprintf("%s%d", g, i),
        fastq_path = FASTQ, 
        stringsAsFactors = F)
      )
  }
}

MAP_FILE <- system.file("extdata", "toydata", "sg2gene.csv", package="CB2")
sgrna_count <- run_sgrna_quant(FASTA, df_design, MAP_FILE)
  
sgrna_stat <- measure_sgrna_stats(sgrna_count$count, df_design, 
                                  "Base", "Low", 
                                  ge_id = "gene",
                                  sg_id = "id")
gene_stat <- measure_gene_stats(sgrna_stat)
```

Or you could run the example with the following commented code.

```r
sgrna_count <- run_sgrna_quant(FASTA, df_design)
sgrna_stat <- measure_sgrna_stats(sgrna_count$count, df_design, "Base", "Low")
gene_stat <- measure_gene_stats(sgrna_stat)
```
